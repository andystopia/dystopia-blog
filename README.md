# Dystopia Blogging

Time for me to continue the age old tradition
of writing my own blogging system. 

My theory is that blogging is fundamentall a 
way to convert a file into HTML, and put 
that HTML file into a folder, if anything else
is needed, then it's fine to implement that yourself,
and I also think that using pandoc out of the box 
makes a lot of sense.
